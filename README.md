# Gas Leakage Detection

Gas leakge leads to various accidents resulting in both matrieal loss and human injuries.The risk of explosion,firing,suffocation based on their physical properties such as toxicity etc.The number of deaths due to explosion of gas cylinders has been increasing in recent years.To avoid this problem is a need for a system to detect the leakage of LPG gas.
The main objective of this project is to,

 1.To detect LPG gas leakage.

 2.To give an alarm.

 3.T send message to the user.
 
 4.To display message on LCD Screen.
